### 1. Wet-on-Wet
Apply wet paint onto pre-wet paper to allow colors to blend and flow freely. This technique produces smooth, atmospheric transitions, ideal for painting **clouds, skies, mist, or soft shadows**.

> 🌊 Let the water guide the paint—it’s perfect for dreamy and loose effects.

---

### 2. Wet-on-Dry

\Apply wet paint on dry paper to retain **crisp edges and clear shapes**. This is useful for **fine details**, **lettering**, or **building up defined forms** layer by layer.

> ✍️ Use this method for more control over shapes and to add final touches.

### 3. Dry Brush

With minimal water on your brush, drag paint across the surface to create **scratchy, textured marks**. Ideal for adding **rough surfaces, grasses, fur, or wood grain**.

> 🪵 Excellent for details that require a weathered or natural look.

### 4. Lifting

While the paint is still damp (or even dry), use a **damp brush, tissue, or sponge** to lift pigment off the paper. This technique can create **highlights, clouds, or soft textures**.

> 💧 Use clean water and a soft touch to avoid damaging the paper.

### 5. Splattering

Tap or flick your brush to scatter drops of paint onto your work. This energetic technique is great for **starry skies, snowfall, flowers, or abstract accents**.

> 🎇 Try using different brush sizes for varied droplet effects.

### 6. Salt Texture

Sprinkle coarse or fine salt onto wet paint and watch as it absorbs water and pigment to form **crystallized, organic textures**. It’s perfect for **galaxies, ocean surfaces, or backgrounds**.

> 🧂 Timing matters—add salt while the paint is wet but not overly saturated.

---

### 7. Gradient Wash
Start with pure pigment and gradually add water to lighten the tone as you move across the paper. This creates **a smooth transition of color**—ideal for **sunsets, backgrounds, or layered skies**.

> 🌅 Keep your brush moist and blend edges as you go for a flawless fade.
