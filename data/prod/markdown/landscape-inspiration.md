### 🌅 Sunrise Over Hills

Capture the peaceful calm of dawn with soft, warm gradients and gentle rolling hills. Focus on building a glowing sky using **wet-on-wet washes**, blending oranges, pinks, and soft blues. Silhouetted trees or hills in the foreground create contrast and depth.

Try to keep the composition minimal to enhance the feeling of stillness and light. Use light strokes and low-saturation colors to suggest distant fog or early morning mist.

### 🏞️ Mountain Reflections

This scene combines powerful forms with gentle water reflections. Create sharp mountain peaks using angular brushstrokes, and mirror their shapes in a calm lake below. Use cool tones like blue, gray, and green for a serene feel.

Blending with a soft brush helps achieve **realistic reflections**, while dry brushing or stippling can add texture to rock faces or grassy shorelines. Keep your horizon line level to maintain natural balance in the composition.

### 🌲 Forest Trail

A winding path or trail invites the viewer into your painting. Forest scenes are ideal for experimenting with **layering**—use darker tones for the foreground trees and lighter, less detailed ones in the background for depth.

Dry brush techniques are useful for bark textures, while sponging or stippling can suggest leaves and underbrush. Include soft shadows on the trail and dappled light filtering through the canopy to make the scene feel alive.

### 🌻 Flower Field

Bursting with color, flower fields are a joyful way to explore **texture, movement, and contrast**. Paint a base layer of green using sweeping strokes, then add scattered wildflowers using splatter effects, dots, and dabs of bright pigment.

Use a variety of colors—yellow, purple, pink, red—for the flowers, but keep your palette harmonious. Try adding a faded horizon or sky to guide the viewer's eye toward the distance.

### 🌊 Coastal Cliffs

Combine rugged rock forms with the dynamic energy of the sea. Use a palette knife to create **rock textures**, while layered brushwork or lifting techniques can mimic waves, spray, and sea foam.

Contrast is key—use darker tones for the cliffs and lighter blues and whites for the water. Pay attention to movement in the ocean to make the scene feel powerful and natural.

### 🌾 Countryside Farmhouse

A nostalgic and calming subject, this scene focuses on man-made structures blending into nature. Use warm earthy tones for the farmhouse and golden hues for surrounding fields.

Perspective is important here—sketch basic shapes first to get proportions right. Use horizontal strokes for fields and angled lines for rooftops. Add simple trees, fences, or clouds to build a peaceful rural composition.

## ✨ Tips for Landscape Painting

- Begin with a **light pencil sketch** to establish composition and major shapes.
- Stick to a **limited color palette** to unify your painting and create mood.
- Always paint **from background to foreground**, layering elements as you go.
- Use changes in **color intensity and detail** to create depth—distant elements should be lighter and less detailed.
- Consider the **direction of light** and how it affects shadows, highlights, and mood.
- Don’t be afraid to **simplify**—you don’t have to paint every tree or blade of grass.
- Most importantly: **capture emotion**, not just accuracy.
