## 🎯 Basic Acrylic Techniques

Learn these essential techniques to start painting confidently. Each method allows you to create different effects and build your own unique painting style using acrylics.

### 1. Dry Brush
Dry brushing uses very little paint on a dry brush to create rough, scratchy textures. It’s great for adding highlights, fine details, or creating a distressed, aged look on textured surfaces like canvas or wood.

### 2. Wash
A wash involves diluting acrylic paint with water to create translucent layers. It’s perfect for backgrounds, gradients, or adding a watercolor-like effect while retaining control and vibrancy in your painting.

### 3. Layering
Layering allows you to build up depth by applying multiple coats of paint, letting each one dry before adding the next. This technique helps create dimension, shadows, and richer color tones in your artwork.

### 4. Blending
Blending smoothly mixes two or more colors on the canvas while they are still wet. It's ideal for skies, gradients, skin tones, and achieving realistic effects with a soft, seamless transition between colors.

### 5. Stippling

Stippling uses repeated dots or small dabs of color to build texture and detail. It’s great for painting foliage, rough textures, and adding depth to abstract pieces or landscapes.

## 🧠 Tips for Beginners

- Always clean brushes immediately after use.
- Use a stay-wet palette to prevent paint from drying out.
- Start with simple subjects and compositions.
- Practice mixing colors instead of relying only on store-bought shades.
- Work from dark to light or light to dark based on your style.

These mediums enhance the performance of acrylic paint:

- **Gloss or Matte Medium**: Adjust finish and transparency
- **Retarder**: Slows drying time
- **Modeling Paste**: Adds texture and body
