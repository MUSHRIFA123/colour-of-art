### 🖼️ Choosing the Right Canvas: Your Surface Matters

A canvas is more than just a surface—it’s the foundation of your artwork. Choosing the right canvas affects how your paint behaves, how long your work lasts, and even how easy it is to apply strokes. Here's a complete guide to picking the perfect canvas for your painting needs.

## 🔲 Types of Canvas Fabric

### 1. Cotton Canvas  
Affordable, flexible, and lightweight, cotton is ideal for beginners and everyday painting. It’s absorbent and works well with acrylics and oils.

> ✅ Pros: Inexpensive, smooth, stretches well  
> ⚠️ Cons: Less durable than linen  

### 2. Linen Canvas  
Linen is strong, long-lasting, and used by professional artists. Its texture (tooth) holds paint better, making it great for detailed or textured work.

> ✅ Pros: Durable, fine weave, archival quality  
> ⚠️ Cons: Expensive and harder to stretch

## 📐 Canvas Formats & Sizes

- **Canvas Panel**: Affordable, compact, perfect for practice.
- **Stretched Canvas**: Pre-stretched on wood, ready to hang.
- **Canvas Roll**: Large-scale projects; you stretch it yourself.
- **Canvas Pad**: Portable sheets for studies and travel.

> 🧠 Tip: Start small (8x10 or 12x16") for manageable projects.

## 🎨 Surface Texture (Tooth)

- **Fine Grain** – Ideal for detail (portraits, fine art).
- **Medium Grain** – Versatile, good for general use.
- **Rough Grain** – Adds natural texture (landscapes, abstracts).

## 🧴 Pre-Primed vs Unprimed

- **Pre-Primed**: Already coated with gesso—just start painting.
- **Unprimed**: Must apply 1–3 layers of gesso to prep the surface.

> 🎨 Acrylics need at least one gesso layer; oils need more to prevent paint soaking into fibers.

## 🧠 Final Tip

The canvas you choose should match your **medium**, **style**, and **budget**. Practice on panels or pads, and move to stretched linen when you're ready to create long-lasting gallery pieces.
