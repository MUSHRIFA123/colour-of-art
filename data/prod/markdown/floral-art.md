### 🌷 Tulip Trio

m perfect for learning the balance between form and flow. Focus on the natural curve of the petals and the slender, elegant stems.

### 🌻 Sunflower Radiance

Bold, confident, and **sun-kissed with energy**, sunflowers symbolize joy and strength. Their large round centers and radiating petals offer an excellent study in symmetry and repetition.

This piece challenges artists to explore **texture** using both dry brush and palette knife techniques for the center, while maintaining soft, sweeping strokes for the petals. The contrast between dark brown and golden yellow makes it ideal for practicing **value range and saturation**.

### 🪻 Lavender Fields

Soft, romantic, and **full of gentle movement**, lavender fields are perfect for painting peaceful scenes with depth and color harmony. The vertical structure of lavender stalks helps guide composition and perspective.

Use **wet-on-wet** washes for distant foliage and dry brush techniques for closer blooms. Subtle variations in violet, lilac, and blue offer a perfect opportunity to practice **color blending and cool tone layering**.

This type of painting works especially well as a horizontal panoramic view or as a framed botanical close-up.

### 🪷 Lotus in Water

The lotus is not just beautiful but also deeply symbolic in art and spirituality—representing purity, peace, and growth. Painting a lotus over water teaches both **composition** and **reflection** techniques.

Focus on petal overlap, symmetrical layering, and soft shadows. Use **glazing** to create luminous petals, and a smooth, watery background to contrast the crisp floral lines. Water ripples and reflected light on petals add realism and serenity to the overall image.

Perfect for experimenting with **layered washes** and subtle gradients.

### 🌹 Classic Rose

No floral art gallery is complete without a rose. Roses are challenging and rewarding for artists due to their spiral center, layered petals, and color variations.

Study the **petal folds** carefully to capture their elegance and flow. Focus on **value contrast**, starting from the rich shadows in the inner petals to the soft edges of the outer ones. Try both traditional red and unusual tones like blue, white, or peach to experiment with emotion and mood.

A perfect subject for improving **control, precision, and realism**.

### 🌼 Daisies in a Jar

This charming still life combines floral forms with the complexity of glass reflection. Daisies offer simplicity in shape but require precision in the white space between petals. The jar introduces the need to study **transparency, reflections, and highlights**.

This project is excellent for developing **observation skills**. Practice painting water lines, glass curves, and soft shadows beneath the vase. It’s also a fun way to explore composition and create a cheerful, rustic atmosphere.

## 🧠 Floral Painting Tips

- **Begin with loose sketches** to understand shapes and arrangement before adding paint.
- **Start light, go dark**—layer transparent washes and deepen shadows gradually.
- Use a **round brush** for petal edges and a **rigger or liner brush** for stems and veins.
- Observe **real flowers or reference photos** to understand their natural variations.
- Experiment with **backgrounds**: bold solid tones, gradient washes, or abstract splashes can dramatically change the final mood.
- Try **limiting your palette** to three main colors to develop harmony.
