## 🛢️ What is Oil Paint?

Oil paint is made by mixing pigments with drying oils like linseed, safflower, or walnut oil. It dries slowly, allowing artists time to blend, build texture, and make changes.

**Benefits of oil paint:**
- Long drying time for blending
- Rich, vibrant colors
- Thick, buttery texture
- Excellent for layering and glazing
- Archival quality with proper care

## 🧠 Basic Techniques for Oil Painting

These foundational techniques will help you understand how to work with oil paints:

---

### 1. Fat Over Lean

Apply “fat” (more oil) layers on top of “lean” (less oil) ones. This helps prevent cracking as thicker layers dry slower than thinner ones underneath.

---

### 2. Glazing

Apply transparent paint layers over dry areas to create luminous effects, enhance depth, and shift colors subtly without repainting.

---

### 3. Impasto

Use thick paint and visible brush strokes or palette knife to build texture. Great for adding drama, movement, or tactile quality.

---

### 4. Blending

Take advantage of oil paint’s slow drying time to blend smoothly. Use soft brushes to fade between tones or create gradients.

---

### 5. Scumbling

Apply a dry, broken layer of lighter paint over dark dry paint to create soft textures and light effects. Ideal for clouds or mist.

## 💡 Oil Painting Tips for Beginners

- **Work in a well-ventilated area** – Solvents can be harmful if inhaled in closed spaces.  
- **Use limited palette** – Fewer colors can actually improve your mixing skills.  
- **Clean brushes well** – Use oil or solvent after every session.  
- **Use a medium, not water** – Oil and water don’t mix!  
- **Let layers dry** – Patience is key when working with oil.  
- **Start with small canvases** – Practice technique before working big.

## 🧼 How to Clean Up Safely

1. Wipe off excess paint with a rag.  
2. Rinse in odorless mineral spirits.  
3. Wash with brush soap or mild dish soap.  
4. Dry flat before storing.

*Never pour solvents down the drain—use proper hazardous waste disposal methods.*
